            We have started our journey from December 2014. It was a nice day. Throughout this time we
            have got a lot of help from some of the exporter and importer. We were a little company once but now
            we are big. At first we have had a lots of problem. We didn't have a office. Then time pass by and
            we gather experience and learnt a lot through this. I am the Manager of this company. But I rarely have
            to do a lot. My big brother Md. Ahsan Ahmed always helped me learning this market. He did a lots of
            hard work for this company. For him we survived several time. So all credit goes to Md. Ahsan Ahmed,
            the CEO of Steel King International.
